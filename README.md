# WasteManagementSystem
The main aim of this project is to analyze waste management trends in Singapore and propose actionable insights to reduce waste and maximize recycling efforts.
The analysis focuses on identifying key waste categories, tracking recycling performance, and estimating energy saved through recycling efforts to support Singapore's zero-waste goals. The initial database is obtained from Kaggle made by Abid Ali Awan.

This project can be leveraged for data analytics and visualization to optimize waste management strategies. Businesses can integrate larger datasets, automate data collection, and expand insights to support real-time decision-making and sustainability reporting. The system can also be enhanced to include predictive analytics for future waste trends, aligning with long-term environmental goals.
